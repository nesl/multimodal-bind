# SUNRGBD Dataset


## Download the dataset
Refer to the [SUN RGB-D](https://rgbd.cs.princeton.edu/) project page for the dataset download. Since MMBind requires data from three modalities, we apply the Segment Anything library to generate synthetic semantic segmentation maps. 


## Running the Code
Refer to the subdirectories `SUN_RGBD` and `SUN_RGBD_Label` for sensor binding and label binding.
