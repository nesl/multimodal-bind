# MMBind: Multimodal Bind with the Shared Modality
This is a repo for SenSys 2024 submission: " MMBind: Unleashing the Potential of Distributed and Heterogeneous Data for Multimodal Learning in IoT ".

# Requirements
The program has been tested in the following environment: 
* Python 3.9.7
* Pytorch 1.8.1
* torchvision 0.9.1
* sklearn 0.24.2
* opencv-python 4.5.5
* numpy 1.20.3

* Stage 1 of MMbind: 
	* pairing incomplete data with shared modalities;
* Stage 2 of MMbind: 
	*  weighted contrastive learning with heterogeneous data.
